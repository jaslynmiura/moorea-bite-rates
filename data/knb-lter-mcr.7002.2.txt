      These data describe bite rates of two abundant species of roving herbivorous fishes found on the forereef, Chlorurus sordidus (Scaridae), and Ctenochaetus striatus (Acanthuridae). During several days in July and August 2010, a SCUBA diver followed individual focal fish for a period of up to 5 minutes and recorded the number of bites taken as well the types of substrates bitten. Upon randomly locating a focal individual, divers estimated the total length of that individual as well as their depth at the initiation (and termination) of the observation. Data are organized in two data tables. The first data table (Focal_Herbivore_Bite_Rates) contains individuals that were observed at two depths (~ 10 m and ~ 17 m) at LTER 1 as part of a balanced sampling design (see Sampling Protocol/Design). The second data table (Additional_Bite_Rate_Data) contains individuals that were observed opportunistically at LTER 1 and Resilience 2. To minimize the effect of time of day on fish behavior, all data were collected between 10:00 and 16:00, a period of time which corresponds with peak feeding rates for many herbivorous fishes.
       This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under
        Grant No. OCE 16-37396 (and earlier awards) as well as a generous gift from the Gordon and
        Betty Moore Foundation. Research was completed under permits issued by the French Polynesian
        Government (Délégation à la Recherche) and the Haut-commissariat de la République en
        Polynésie Francaise (DTRT) (Protocole d'Accueil 2005-2018). This work represents a
        contribution of the Moorea Coral Reef (MCR) LTER Site.

            Diver Observation
            For the first data table (Focal_Herbivore_Bite_Rates), focal fish were
                            observed during five different hour-long sampling periods (1:
                            10:00-11:00; 2: 11:00-12:00, 3: 12:00-1:00, 4: 14:00-15:00, 5:
                            15:00-16:00) local Moorea time. During each period two SCUBA divers each attempted to
                            observe three individuals of each species for a period of five minutes.
                            This protocol was repeated at two depths (~ 10 m and ~ 17 m) to enable
                            among depth comparisons at this site. While divers were unable to
                            recognize individual fish, observations at both depths were carried out
                            in a large area to avoid repeatedly sampling the same individuals.
